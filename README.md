# Trash-AntiCheat
A free, open source AntiCheat for your indie game.

# How to use
> TrashAC.py -lauch "path to launch file here" -scantype "once or forever"

If Trash AntiCheat detects a safe enviornment than it will launch the file you choose. You can also set the scan type, once, for just on startup or forever to scan the computer for issues forever.

----------------------------

Please note that this is still in development and is not the best option, for the best option please look at non-open source AntiCheats. This is just a free solution for developers who have a limited budget and don't want to add a big AntiCheat into their game. You can compile into an exe using PyInstaller if you want, just remember to do so without the terminal window ;)
